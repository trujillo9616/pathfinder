# Pathfinder Project!

## About

This project was made to further my understanding of React with TypeScript, and most importantly: _Graph Theory_. It is a Pathfinder that allows you to visualize the path that would be generated by the chosen algorithm. This first iteration includes the following algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A\* Search
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

The plan is to add more algorithms in the future. Though this is a work in progress, I hope you enjoy it!

You can find the live version of the project [here](https://pathfinder-truji.vercel.app/).

If you want to run it locally, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Feel free to open an issue if you find any bugs or have any suggestions! You can also reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trujillo9616) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/trujillo9616/).
